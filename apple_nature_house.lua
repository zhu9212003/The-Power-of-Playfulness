-- The Power of Playfulness in Lua

-- Introduction

print("Hello! Welcome to Lua and the power of playfulness! This tutorial will focus on how to use Lua to create and explore playful experiences. We'll begin by exploring the core concepts behind Lua and then discuss ways to make use of all of its features to achieve our desired results. Let's get started!")

-- Understanding the Basics

-- 1. Data Types

-- Lua is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables do not need to be declared before they can be used. 

local num = 0 -- declares a variable of type number
local char = “a” -- declares a variable of type character
local bool = true -- declares a variable of type boolean
local str = "Hello World" -- declares a variable of type string

-- 2. Operators

-- In Lua, operators are the symbols used to perform operations on data.

-- Mathematical Operators:

-- + addition
-- - subtraction
-- * multiplication
-- / division
-- ^ power

-- Comparison Operators: 

-- == equal to
-- ~= not equal to
-- > greater than
-- < less than
-- >= greater than or equal to
-- <= less than or equal to

-- Logic Operators:

-- and logical and
-- or logical or
-- not logical not

-- 3. Control Flow

-- Control flow statements are used to control which pieces of code are executed and when.

-- If-Else Statements

if num == 0 then
  print("The number is equal to zero")
else
  print("The number is not equal to zero")
end

-- For Loops

for i = 1, 10 do
  print(i)
end

-- While Loops

while num < 10 do
  num = num + 1
  print(num)
end

-- 4. Functions

-- Functions are used to group related pieces of code together.

function sayHello()
  print("Hello!")
end

sayHello() -- Prints "Hello!"

-- Using Playful Elements

-- 1. Storytelling

-- One example of playful elements in Lua is storytelling. We can use Lua to create a story by setting up the environment, characters, and events.

-- Let's create a simple fantasy story set in a small village. 

local villageName = "Faraon" -- the name of the village
local mainCharacter = "Anna" -- the name of the main character 
local villagerList = {"Jim", "John", "Emily", "Sophia"} -- the names of the villagers

print("Welcome to " .. villageName .. "!")
print("You play as " .. mainCharacter .. ".")
print("The villagers of " .. villageName .. " are:")

for i, villager in ipairs(villagerList) do
    print(villager)
end

-- 2. Interactivity

-- Another example of playful elements in Lua is interactivity. We can use Lua to create interactive experiences by allowing the user to input data that can then be used in a script.

-- Let's create an adventure game where the player needs to guess a number.

local randomNum = math.random(1, 10) -- Generate a random number between 1 and 10
local playerGuess = 0 -- Variable to store the player's guess

print("Welcome to the guessing game!")

while playerGuess ~= randomNum do -- Keep looping until the player guesses the correct number
  print("Please enter your guess:")
  playerGuess = io.read() -- Read the input from the player
  if tonumber(playerGuess) == randomNum then -- Check if the player guessed correctly
    print("You guessed the correct number!")
  else
    print("That's not correct, please try again!")
  end
end

-- 3. Animation

-- Finally, we can also use Lua to create animations. We can do this by creating a loop which continually updates the screen with different images or shapes. This can be used to simulate movement or other dynamic effects.

local xPos = 0 -- Variable to store the x position of the shape

-- Create a loop which repeats 10 times
for i = 1, 10 do
  -- Draw a square at the current x position
  love.graphics.rectangle("fill", xPos, 0, 50, 50)
  -- Update the x position for the next iteration
  xPos = xPos + 10
  -- Wait for 1 second before continuing
  love.timer.sleep(1)
end

-- Conclusion
